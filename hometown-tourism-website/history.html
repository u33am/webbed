            <h2>Our Rich History</h2>
            <p>The city of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, is located on the Pothohar Plateau within the Islamabad Capital Territory—one of the earliest known sites of human settlement in Asia.</p>

            <h3>🏛️ Ancient Civilizations</h3>
            <p>Archaeological discoveries suggest that the Pothohar region has been **inhabited for thousands of years**. It was home to the **Soanian Culture**, one of the earliest known Stone Age cultures in the world.</p>
        
            <h3>🕌 The Mughal & British Influence</h3>
            <p>During the **Mughal era**, the region flourished as an important trade and cultural hub. Later, under **British rule**, it remained a key center for administrative and military activities.</p>
    
            <h3>🏗️ Development of Islamabad as the Capital</h3>
            <p>Before 1960, **Karachi was the capital** of Pakistan. However, due to **strategic and geographical reasons**, Islamabad was chosen as the new capital. The city was designed by **Greek architect Constantinos Doxiadis**, and its construction began in 1961.</p>
    
            <h3>🛕 Buddhist Heritage in Islamabad</h3>
            <p>In **2015-16**, archaeologists unearthed the remains of a **Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran**, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves. These findings confirm Islamabad’s deep-rooted **religious and cultural diversity**.</p>
