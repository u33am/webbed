            <h2>Our Rich History</h2>
            <p>The city of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, is located on the Pothohar Plateau within the Islamabad Capital Territory—one of the earliest known sites of human settlement in Asia.</p>

            <h3>🏛️ Ancient Civilizations</h3>
            <p>Archaeological discoveries suggest that the Pothohar region has been <strong>inhabited for thousands of years</strong>. It was home to the <strong>Soanian Culture</strong>, one of the earliest known Stone Age cultures in the world.</p>
        
            <h3>🕌 The Mughal & British Influence</h3>
            <p>During the <strong>Mughal era</strong>, the region flourished as an important trade and cultural hub. Later, under <strong>British rule</strong>, it remained a key center for administrative and military activities.</p>
    
            <h3>🏗️ Development of Islamabad as the Capital</h3>
            <p>Before 1960, <strong>Karachi was the capital</strong> of Pakistan. However, due to <strong>strategic and geographical reasons</strong>, Islamabad was chosen as the new capital. The city was designed by <strong>Greek architect Constantinos Doxiadis</strong>, and its construction began in 1961.</p>
    
            <h3>🛕 Buddhist Heritage in Islamabad</h3>
            <p>In <strong>2015-16</strong>, archaeologists unearthed the remains of a <strong>Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran</strong>, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves. These findings confirm Islamabad’s deep-rooted <strong>religious and cultural diversity</strong>.</p>
