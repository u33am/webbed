# CS1534 Web Development
# Programming Exercise 1

Please transfer your progress from your local environment to here.

## How do I do that using Git?
Commit all your progress to GitHub.
On your GitHub repository page, copy the **SSH** link from the green `Code` button.
Make sure you have connected your Codio account with your GitHub account, then open a terminal and run `git clone git@github.com/<your-name>/<your-repository>`

## How do I do that manually?
**I have been using Codio**
- Go to your original repository and hover on "Project", then select "Export as ZIP".
- Extract your root folder from the resulting ZIP file.

**I have been working on a local computer/laptop**
- Continue reading.

Go to your assignment repository (this one) and make sure the Codio file directory tree on the left is open.

Right-click on the root directory (CS1534 Web Dev...) and select "Upload". 
Then, you can upload your progress as a folder from the other repository and continue your progress here.

**NOTE:** Your git branch will not move along, so you would have to setup git anew with the proper branches.
